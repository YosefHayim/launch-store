/**
 * Shared vocabulary for `launch plan` / `launch drift` — the read-only diff of `launch.config.ts`
 * against live store state (see `docs/adr/0003-plan-drift.md`).
 *
 * Where `core/ascSync.ts` *applies* a per-app reconcile and `core/adopt` *imports* live state into
 * config, plan only *reports*: it runs every registered {@link SurfacePlanner} in dry-run and aggregates
 * the diff each already computes. A planner owns one config-as-code surface (the ASC product catalog,
 * the App Store listing, Play products, …) across every app; the orchestrator never names a concrete
 * surface, so adding one is a new file + one `registerSurfacePlanner()` line — exactly the "implement an
 * interface + register it" seam the provider and adopter registries use.
 *
 * These types describe the *plan mechanism*, not a config shape, so they live here rather than in
 * `core/types.ts` — the same reason `ascSync.ts` keeps `AscCatalogApi`/`PlannedAction` local.
